# The Image classifier is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for our Machine Learning project Image Cassifier.
  ## I am going to use the VGG16 pre-trained model available on Tensorflow to easily build a Image Classifier.
  
  ## The VGG16 model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset in order to quickly build a robust image classifier. In fact, the ImageNet dataset comprised of a huge amount of images (14 million) and about 21 thousand classes, making it therefore quite complete for this type of task.
